ESPGem
======

Basic Ruby gem to access ESPN's public API.

If you are looking for a more complete and reliable ESPN API gem, I would recommend
checking out rondale-sc's EspnRb (https://github.com/rondale-sc/EspnRb).

I am not making this gem out of need for its functionality, but rather to better understand the process of making and testing a gem.
